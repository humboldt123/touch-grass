**What is Touch Grass**

We love bringing people together! Touch Grass is a cross-platform app that __leverages AI for social good__ to help facilitate connections between people we think vibe together. We do this by giving users the **freedom to select activities that interest them**. With everyone's preferences being sent to the backend, our AI matches people it thinks are a good fit, then invites the user to no more than **one activity per day** so as not to overwhelm. The user can then accept the invite (if they wish). People get together and have a fun time! 

The name was Naron's idea.
